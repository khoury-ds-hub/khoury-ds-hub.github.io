<h1>A Few Good Men (and Women)</h1>
<p>2020-02-10 21:30</p>
<p>Our march towards global domination continues as we begin to formalize the
  structure of our executive board!  We've made progress by leaps and bounds in
  the past few weeks as we strive to become an official club, but we're still
  in need of a few good men and women to fulfill key roles in our organization.
  We still have many VP and Director positions open to grads and undergrads,
  respectively.  In addition, we are always eager to accept volunteers for
  Associate positions in our various departments! </p>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to shoot an email to
   our intrepid leader at khourydshub@gmail.com.</p>

    <li>Presently, our organization consists of the following departments:
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>The Finance Deparment handles expenses and budgetary matters.</li>
            <li>Operations is responsible for booking facilities and maintaining the club website.</li>
            <li>The Academic Team is responsible for developing material for our
              lecture series in the Data Sessions.</li>
            <li>Marketing is responsible for getting the word out!
              They manage social media and handle ad campaigns.</li>
            <li>The purpose of the Projects and Relations Division is to plan
              activities for project nights and to handle relations with other
              clubs and organizations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
